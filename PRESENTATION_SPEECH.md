## 📝 Speech Script by Slide

### Slide 1: Title (20 sec)

> "Good afternoon! My name is [Your Name]. The topic of my research is the analysis of educational content quality generated by GPT artificial intelligence for English language learning."

---

### Slide 2: Problem & Relevance (40 sec)

> "Today, artificial intelligence is being actively integrated into education. ChatGPT, Duolingo, and other platforms use AI to generate learning materials. But an important question arises: how good is the content that AI can create? Can we trust it with something as important as language education? This is exactly the question I investigated in my research."

---

### Slide 3: Goal & Hypothesis (30 sec)

> "The goal of my research is to evaluate the quality of automatically generated exercises based on four criteria: grammatical correctness, level appropriateness, educational value, and language naturalness. My hypothesis is that AI can generate content with a quality rating of at least 80 percent."

---

### Slide 4: Research Object — EnglishAI (50 sec)

> "The object of my research is EnglishAI, a platform I developed myself. It's a web application for learning English using artificial intelligence. The platform includes 8 features: an essay topic generator, dialogue creator, grammar exercises, error hunting, level test, story generator, and more. All exercises are created by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model in real time."

---

### Slide 5: Methodology (40 sec)

> "For my research, I analyzed 65 content samples from 6 platform features. Each sample was rated on a scale from 1 to 5 points across four parameters. A score of 5 means perfect quality, while 1 means unacceptable for learning purposes. The scores were then converted into quality percentages."

---

### Slide 6: Results — Fill the Blank (50 sec)

> "Let's look at the results. The Fill the Blank feature generates grammar exercises. For example: 'She ___ to Paris twice' — the answer is 'been', with the hint 'be'. I analyzed 15 such exercises. The overall quality was 91.4%. Grammatical correctness scored 96%, but topic relevance was only 78%. Sometimes the AI created exercises on a different grammar topic than requested."

---

### Slide 7: Results — Error Hunt (40 sec)

> "The Error Hunt feature asks users to find errors in sentences. For example: 'He go to school every day' — the error is in 'go', the correct form is 'goes'. The AI generates typical mistakes that language learners actually make, and provides clear explanations. The quality of this feature is 97.6%, with 100% grammatical correctness."

---

### Slide 8: Results — Dialogues & Level Test (50 sec)

> "The dialogue generator creates realistic conversations for three difficulty levels. For the Easy level, it generates simple dialogues at a café; for the Hard level, it creates business negotiations with complex vocabulary. Dialogue quality is 97.8%. The level test showed a perfect result — 100%. Questions are correctly distributed from A1 to C1, with proper difficulty progression."

---

### Slide 9: Summary Table (40 sec)

> "Here is the summary table of results. The best scores go to Level Test at 100% and Essay Topics at 99%. The lowest score is Fill the Blank at 91.4%, due to topic relevance issues. The overall content quality across all features is 97.2%. This significantly exceeds the 80% threshold set in my hypothesis."

---

### Slide 10: Conclusions (40 sec)

> "Here are my conclusions. The hypothesis is fully confirmed — the quality score is 97.2%. The AI's strengths include: perfect grammar at 99.2%, natural language, and high educational value. The weakness: sometimes the content doesn't match the requested topic. My recommendation is to add topic validation to the system."

---

### Slide 11: Closing (20 sec)

> "In conclusion: GPT artificial intelligence is capable of generating high-quality educational content, comparable to materials created by human teachers. The EnglishAI platform is available on GitHub. Thank you for your attention! I'm ready to answer your questions."

## ❓ Possible Questions & Answers

### Q1: Why did you choose GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4?

> "GPT-3.5 is more cost-effective for educational purposes and still provides excellent quality. My research shows 97.2% quality, which proves GPT-3.5 is sufficient for language learning applications."

### Q2: What are the limitations of your research?

> "The main limitations are the sample size of 65 items and subjective evaluation criteria. Future research could include larger samples and independent expert evaluation."

### Q3: Can this platform replace human teachers?

> "No, the platform is designed to supplement, not replace, human teachers. It provides additional practice materials, but teacher guidance remains essential for effective learning."

### Q4: How did you evaluate 'educational value'?

> "Educational value was assessed based on whether the exercise teaches something useful, has clear learning objectives, and provides appropriate feedback to learners."

### Q5: What would you improve in your platform?

> "I would add topic validation to ensure content matches the requested grammar topic, and implement user progress tracking for personalized learning."
